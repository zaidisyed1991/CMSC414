username="kathy"
password="' or '1'='1"

If we plug in the values above for $username and $password, the sql query will look like this when executed:
"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'kathy' and password = '' or '1'= '1';"
And this would return the row where 'kathy' is the username and regardless of the password
