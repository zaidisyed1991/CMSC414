comment="doing great!", "bob":"you got this!", "charlie":"you rock!"}' -- '"

SQL Query: UPDATE posts SET comments = '{"bob":"woah","kathy":"doing great!", "bob":"you got this!", "charlie":"you rock!"}' -- '"}' WHERE post_id = 4
removing commented code: UPDATE posts SET comments = '{"bob":"woah","kathy":"doing great!", "bob":"you got this!", "charlie":"you rock!"}'

Q: why does bob say "you got this!" instead of "woah"?
A: Because when parsing the json string, we have two occurances of key "bob" and only the last occurance of "bob" is taken into account
