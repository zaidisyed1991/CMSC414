 * Build instructions:
 *   We will turn standard protections off (ASLR, canaries, etc.).
 *   We will be building this with the Makefile provided; you may not make
 *   any changes to the Makefile.
 *
 * Submission instructions:
 *   You must submit *three* separate files (task0a.c, task0b.c, task0c.c),
 *   each of which implements a *fundamentally different* version of
 *   your_fcn(), each of which wins the "impossible game".
